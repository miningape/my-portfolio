My pretty awful portfolio website

First let me say one thing: I'm a programmer not a graphics designer.

SO yeah, this website looks pretty god damn awful even by early 2000's standards. So don't judge me too hard for not being able to use HTML and CSS
For this project I mainly focussed on the backend code, because it's what interests me, and I really wanted to learn the process of putting a website online from essentially scratch.

This project was built in node.js and uses the MEAN stack, and was originally published on heroku (a server hosting service). This awful website disgraced the internet for about a year until I stopped paying for the domain.

Personally, I really liked making this project and was one of the hardest but most fun programming experience I've had so far.
